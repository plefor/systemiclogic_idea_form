# Systemiclogic "Idea Capture Form" Developer Test

This is a front-end concept for an "Idea capture form", as required by Systemiclogic for their developer test.

Requirements for this test Include:
  - Creating a HTML page with a required set of input fields
  - Using a CSS library, of choice, to style the form and make it responsive.
  - Certain input fields should required, or even be validated before the form can be submitted.
  - The form should post to https://httpbin.org/post, with the JSON string being displayed after a successful attempt.

### Version
1.0.0

### Technology

This form uses the following open source projects to work properly:

* [Twitter Bootstrap] -  This was used as the CSS library. A very common and easy to use tool. This library made it easy to meet the requirements of the test.
* [jQuery] - This was the JavaScript Library used. This Library had all the needed functionality, with an ease of use, needed to complete the functionality of the form.

The amount of libraries used was kept to a minimum. This allows the form to remain small, simple and efficient but still accomplish the necessary tasks needed from it.

### Installation and Usage

   - Download ZIP file of the master branch.
   - Unzip the files.
   - Open the "index.html" file in your browser of choice (preferably chrome).

Alternatively, just visit http://plefor.github.io/ to run the form.

### Future Development

A Server-Side implementation, to pair with this form, is currently being considered as the next step of development.
